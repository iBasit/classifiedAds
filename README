## Application Description

- The project will have to make use of a database with two tables - ads and users. An ad
has to have an id, user id, title, description, price and creation date. A user has to have
an id, email, name and an auth token.
- A default test user has to be added to the database (id: 1, email:  test@octopuslabs.com,
name: testuser, authtoken: TkpJe8qr9hjbqPwCHi0n).
- The API has to support 3 operations:
    - Listing all ads that exist in the database, starting with the latest ones. The list
should include all fields belonging to the ad, as well as name and email of the
user who created it.
    - Creating a new ad
    - Modifying usersâ€™ own ads
- The API will only allow to create/edit ads for users with a valid token. Listing ads is
public.
- Input fields need to be validated (e.g. price needs to be numeric), as well as correct http
codes returned.
- Every time an ad is created, it needs to be automatically shared on multiple social media
channels. Create a method to do so (do not implement the logic - make it sleep for 1
second instead) and demonstrate how to asynchronously run this method for every
ad.
- If some of the tasks are not entirely clear - please use your best judgement.
